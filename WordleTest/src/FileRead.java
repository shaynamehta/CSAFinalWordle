 * ok so we have to use inheritance in the project so i'm thinking we can use it here since it's the easiest 
 * implementation 
 * we can do like an overall word bank class and then have the themes be "theme" extends WordBank so that
 * if the user selects no theme it just pulls from the main word bank and if they choose a theme it goes to the extended
 * class
 * 
 * its kinda useless but for now that's what i think is the best way to implement inheritance
 * 
 * also in this class we will turn the answer into a String array
